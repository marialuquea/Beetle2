# Beetle2
An artificially-intelligent tool to estimate the whole life carbon emissions of building structures

There are 3 main projects in this repository. CLick on each of them for instructions on how to use them.
- The [python notebook]() used to experiment with the datasets and Machine Learning models
- The [python app]() that can be used as a tool to predict carbon emission of building structures
- The [sketchup ruby app]()


# TODO
- [ ] Change readme: add instructions to open Sketchup plugin and python standalone
