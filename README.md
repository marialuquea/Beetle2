# Beetle<sup>2</sup>
An artificially-intelligent tool to estimate the whole life carbon emissions of building structures

There are 3 main projects in this repository. CLick on each of them for instructions on how to use them.
- The [python notebook](https://github.com/marialuquea/Beetle2/tree/main/Python%20Notebook) used to experiment with the datasets and Machine Learning models
- The [python app](https://github.com/marialuquea/Beetle2/tree/main/Python%20Standalone) that can be used as a tool to predict carbon emission of building structures
- The [sketchup ruby app](https://github.com/marialuquea/Beetle2/tree/main/SketchUpExtensions)


# TODO
- [ ] Change readme: add instructions to open Sketchup plugin and python standalone
